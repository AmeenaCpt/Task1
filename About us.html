<h1>About</h1>
<p>We are farmers.
<br> We produce the healthiest
<br> fruits that nature can grow.</p>
<h2>Our mission</h2>
<h3>Produce the healthiest food that nature can grow</h3>

<p>Regenerative agriculture means that we need to manage 
<br>our farms differently, focusing on soil and plant 
<br>health to reduce costs, improve fruit quality and 
<br>productivity by:</p>
Reducing agrochemical inputs
Enhancing photosynthesis, nutrient cycling,
<br>efficient water use</li>
Diversifying species in the system

<h3>Deliver a positive impact on our environment</h3>

<p>Regenerative agriculture means that we need to fix <br>
the ecosystems on our farms by:</p>

Capturing as much CO2 as possible through photosynthesis</li>
Reinventing our production, packaging and delivery processes
<br> to minimise energy <br>use and carbon emissions.
<h3>Inspire change across the food industry</h3>

<p>Regenerative agriculture means that we need to offer a scalable 
<br>and attractive model to fix ecosystems on a global scale by:</p>

Generating competitive returns
Reviewing customer strategy to achieve the true value of a
<br>regenerative  fruit (customer base, branding and communication)
Sharing information about our processes and outcomes (agronomic,
<br> financial, …)
<h3>About Fruit Farm</h3>
